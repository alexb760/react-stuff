# Simple Read App.

## Course from FrontEnd-master.

[React note course](https://react-v8.holt.courses/)

## Setting up the project:

### Installing package.json, prettier, eslint.

```shell
# Creates a init package.json.
npm init -y
```

```shell
# install the specific prettier version.
npm install --save-dev prettier@2.7.1
```

Note: is needed to create a `.pretierrc` file in the command so that vs will know there is a prettier config.

```shell
#install eslint
npm i -D eslint@8.24.0 eslint-config-prettier@8.5.0
```

Note: Creates a `.eslintrc.json` file.
debuggin in slint `npm run eslint -- --debug` the `--` means pass the debug to the underline command.

```shell
#install vite
npm npm i -D vite@3.1.4 @vitejs/pluigin-react@2.1.0
```

Vite is a build tools will help to deploy locally or build a production app.
Note: make sure to create a `vite.config.js` to configure our build tool.

```shell
#run app local
npm npm run dev
# or
npm vite
```

## Configuring JSX and moving old js to JSX

pay attentions at the changes made in `.eslintrc.json`
notes: [Conf JSX](https://react-v8.holt.courses/)

## Hooks:

link: [Hooks lesson:](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/core-react-concepts/hooks)
In a nutshell, hooks are able to update inputs inside its component.

## Effects:

Link [Effects lesson](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/core-react-concepts/effects).
Effects are used to perform action outside components one of this action could be an API request from third API system.
General notes: are. Effects will render each time a component re-render. So is necessary to pass some dependencies to tell when it will re-render.

```javascript
import { effect, useState } from "react",

const myComponente = () =>{
    const [myVariable, setMyVariable] = useState([]);
    useEfect(() => {
        requestApi();
    })

    async function requestApi(){
        const request = await fetch("http://my-domain/v1/api/request");
        const response = await request.json();
        setMyVariable(response.data);
    }
}
```

```javascript
import { effect, useState } from "react",

const myComponente = () =>{
    const [myVariable, setMyVariable] = useState([]);
    useEfect(() => {
        requestApi();
    }) // by default re-render each time component changes.

    useEfect(() => {
        requestApi();
    }, []) // renders the very first time the component loads.

    useEfect(() => {
        requestApi();
    }, [myArgument]) // Renders any time 'myArgument' changes.

   //...
}
```

## Component composition:

Some time is worthy to extract functions to a separated component:
When:

- When it can be reusable.
- When it isolated logic as a single responsibility principle.
  Why.
- Makes easy testable components.
- Makes readable and understandable components.

### Styling Pet component.

Applying CSS styles to the Pet component.

## Router.

Open capabilities of navigation between pages. So that we can have multiples pages in the same app.
An additional npm dependency is needed. `npm install react-router-dom@6.4.1 `

### useParams.

React-route-dom provide a simple way to take out props from the context. BrowserRoute provide a context where all
variables we sent to the children page can be managed by `useParams()`

## react-query

[react-query lesson](https://react-v8.holt.courses/lessons/react-capabilities/react-query)
React Query do a cache for any fetch operation so that it will not do a request to the API.

```javascript
// inside <BrowserRouter> wrapping everything inside it
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>[â€¦]</QueryClientProvider>
```

And creates the fetch thing handler.

## Class component:

old way to write components in React, still used specially old projects.
Has some small different with functional components: well-defined tuning mechanism.
Class component does not support hooks.
If you need to use something like hooks or similar needs to create a special function

## Error Boundary.

How react handles errors, a class component is needed. Also implement a method `getDerivedStateFromError()`
